This app is designed to help keep track of income and expenses to help analyze the past spendings, and plan finances for the right investments. It suggests strategies to save up money and manage finances, all in an easy-to-use format.
###Customizable Expense Tracking
To make financial management more intuitive and personalized, the app includes a customizable expense tracking system. Users can create personalized "expense boxes" for different types of income and expenses, including sudden or unexpected transactions, making it easier to record and categorize their financial activities. 

###Analytics and Insights
The app provides detailed analytics and insights into users' spending patterns. By analyzing the data, users can better understand where their money goes, identify unnecessary expenses, and find opportunities to save. The app offers tailored suggestions to cut back on spending, optimize savings, and reach financial goals faster. 

###Community Features
Our personal finance management app fosters a sense of community by allowing users to collaborate with friends and family on financial goals. Users can create groups to track collective savings, set shared financial goals (e.g., saving for a group vacation or a shared gift shop), and monitor each other's progress.

###Wishlist Feature
To keep users motivated and focused on their financial goals, the app includes a unique wishlist feature. Users can create a list of desired purchases (like buying a car, a PlayStation, or a new gadget) and set savings goals for each item. The app tracks the user's progress toward these goals and provides insights on how to save more effectively.

###Split Cost Feature
The app simplifies managing shared expenses by offering a robust split cost feature. Users can easily divide expenses among friends or group members, such as for group trips, shared gifts, or communal bills. The app allows users to input various costs, assign them to specific individuals or groups, and automatically calculate each person's share and outstanding balance. 

###Notification Feature

Users receive alerts when they approach or exceed their set spending limits for specific categories, reminders about upcoming bill payments, and notifications about group activities or expense splits.

By sharing their historical expenditures and financial patterns, users can receive tailored advice and guidance from experts to help them make informed decisions. This feature ensures users have access to professional support, maximizing their potential to achieve their financial goals and manage their money more effectively.
